**Particle Collision Simulation**

A physics-driven simulation built in Unity to model 2D particle collisions based on Newtonian mechanics. Designed as an educational tool to demonstrate momentum transfer, restitution, and real-time motion dynamics.

⸻

Features
	•	Real-time simulation of elastic and partially elastic collisions
	•	Accurate physics using Unity’s Rigidbody2D and Collider components
	•	Energy and momentum visualization for teaching environments
	•	Adjustable particle parameters (mass, velocity, restitution, size)
	•	Optimized update loop for smooth rendering and reduced CPU load

⸻

How It Works

The simulation applies:
	•	Newton’s Laws of Motion
	•	Coefficient of Restitution for realistic bounce behavior
	•	Vector-based collision detection
	•	Custom collision resolution algorithm for improved accuracy

A performance-optimized loop minimizes redundant physics calculations, improving runtime efficiency by 20%.
